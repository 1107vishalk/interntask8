Objective

To understand how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) enhance security and privacy by setting up, testing, and evaluating a free VPN service.

Steps Implemented

Selected a reputable free VPN provider and created an account.

Downloaded and installed the VPN client on the system.

Connected to a VPN server (nearest location for better performance).

Verified IP address change using whatismyipaddress.com
.

Confirmed encrypted browsing and verified traffic routing through VPN.

Disconnected VPN and compared IP address and browsing speed differences.

Researched encryption standards, protocols, and privacy features offered by VPNs.

Documented benefits, limitations, and observations.

Key Learnings

VPNs protect user identity by masking IP addresses and encrypting traffic.

They provide safer browsing, especially on public Wi-Fi networks.

Useful for bypassing geo-restrictions and accessing region-specific content.

Free VPNs may have limitations such as restricted bandwidth, slower speeds, and fewer server options.

Always choose VPNs with a no-logs policy and strong encryption standards (AES-256, WireGuard, OpenVPN).
